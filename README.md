# fuzz_util

Credit goes to [Anastasia-Labs](https://github.com/Anastasia-Labs). I took all fuzzers from [aiken-design-patterns/utils.ak](https://github.com/Anastasia-Labs/aiken-design-patterns/blob/main/lib/aiken-design-patterns/utils.ak), because I find them to be gold and I want to add a few more that might be useful.
